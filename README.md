# [IBM Cognitive Class] Recommendation System
 Netflix-like recommendation system with Sklearn

At a Glance
Develop movie recommendation systems using content-based, popularity-based, and collaborative filtering. Learn KNN for similarity computation and analyze movie features such as genre. In this project, you will manipulate data using Pandas and apply machine learning models from Sklearn. The system will identify and suggest movies based on key features such as genres, types, and titles, aligning recommendations with user preferences.

We've all been there – sitting in front of the screen, endlessly scrolling through options, wondering what to watch next. The endless choices can be overwhelming, and finding a movie that perfectly suits your mood feels like a shot in the dark. But, what if you could create your very own movie recommendation system, one that knows your preferences and suggests movies you'll love? 

In this project, you will develop three simple movie recommendation systems. The system is designed to analyze key features of movies, such as genres, types, and titles, to identify and suggest movies that align with your preferences.

There are several types of recommendation systems. In this project, we will be exploring the following types:

Popular-based recommendation: Popular-based recommendation systems are straightforward to implement because they don’t require complex algorithms or user-specific data. They tend to rely on simple stats, such as how often a movie is watched, and end up giving the same recommendations to everyone, pushing what's popular with the masses.
Content-based filtering: This approach focuses on the characteristics of the items themselves. It suggests movies that match the user’s interests by analyzing key features like genres, themes, and styles, offering recommendations tailored to their preferences.
Collaborative filtering: This method relies on the collective preferences of users. It can be user-based, where recommendations are made based on the preferences of similar users, or item-based, where recommendations are made based on items that are similar to what the user has liked in the past.
